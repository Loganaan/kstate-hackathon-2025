# Deepgram Filler Words Configuration

## What Changed

Updated the Deepgram configuration to use the native `filler_words` parameter for more accurate filler word detection.

## Configuration Update

### Before
```typescript
const connection = deepgram.listen.live({
  model: 'nova-2',
  language: 'en-US',
  smart_format: true,
  interim_results: true,
  utterance_end_ms: 1000,
  punctuate: true,
});
```

### After
```typescript
const connection = deepgram.listen.live({
  model: 'nova-2',
  language: 'en-US',
  smart_format: true,
  interim_results: true,
  utterance_end_ms: 1000,
  punctuate: true,
  filler_words: true, // ✨ NEW: Enables native filler word detection
});
```

## What This Does

When `filler_words: true` is set, Deepgram will **include filler words in the transcript** rather than filtering them out. This allows us to detect and provide feedback on:

- `uh`
- `um`
- `mhmm`
- `uh-uh`
- `uh-huh`
- `nuh-uh`

## How It Works

1. **User speaks with filler words**: "So, um, I think that, uh, the solution would be..."
2. **Deepgram transcribes WITH filler words**: "So, um, I think that, uh, the solution would be..."
3. **Our detection logic catches them**: Detects "um" and "uh" in the transcript
4. **User gets immediate feedback**: Pop-up appears and counter increments

## Benefits

✅ **More Accurate**: Uses Deepgram's native speech recognition to identify actual filler words  
✅ **Better Performance**: No need for aggressive pattern matching  
✅ **Standard Filler Words**: Catches the most common filler words automatically  
✅ **Reliable Detection**: Based on acoustic analysis, not just text patterns  

## Additional Detection

Our custom pattern matching (`detectFillerWords` function) still runs to catch additional verbal fillers like:
- "like"
- "you know"
- "actually"
- "basically"
- "literally"
- "kind of"
- "sort of"
- "i mean"

This provides a **two-layer detection system**:
1. **Deepgram native** for acoustic filler words (uh, um, etc.)
2. **Pattern matching** for verbal filler phrases (like, you know, etc.)

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Start a live interview session
2. Speak naturally and intentionally use filler words
3. Watch for pop-ups and counter increments
4. Try different filler words to see the detection in action

Example test phrases:
- "Um, I think this is important"
- "The solution, uh, would be to use Redis"
- "Like, you know, we could implement caching"
- "Basically, uh, the algorithm should be O(n)"
